## What am I learning now

  I am taking my first steps with html5/css + tailwind and bootstrap.

Next I intend split learning into two branches:

**First** Js + one of the popular framework e.g. node, vue or react

**Second** Python + flask  and sql or fimiliar

Equally, I take **daily action** to improve my written english skills and increase my knowleage of Power BI


### This will be  repository of my  notes/cheet-sheets for:

*short markdown guide
*html5/css main things
 *and all fundamentals I want to remenber
 


I am still *rookie* hire, but this will change soon
